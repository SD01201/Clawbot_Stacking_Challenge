Build Overview:

For this assignment we had to build and program a Clawbot to pick up and stack 3D cubes by itself. The tower of blocks stacked by the robot, must stay standing for 10 seconds after the last block is placed. 
The goal was to make the tallest stack, that stays standing.

Port Assignments:

Our drive train is ports 10 and 6. The arm is port 3. And the claw is port 4.

Code:

Our code is programmed to control what our robot will be doing. The robot is placed in the middle, and is programmed to go forward and pick up the cube with it's claw. Then it has to reverse, and do a 
180 degree turn, then proceed to go forward. It places the cube in it's designated place. And this process repeats over and over again, making the tower in the process.

Reflection:

Building our robot was honestly pretty easy, though it did take some time, as sometimes it wouldn't screw in properly. The thing we needed to attach wasn't the right size, etc. Our teamwork was pretty good as well, as we all knew what to do, and how to do it. We helped each other when I, or another person in our group needed help. But the hardest part I'd say was the code. As first of all, our code was reversed. So, if you coded the robot to go forward. It would go backward. Which was pretty annoying. But we just had to change the code so when we wanted it to go forward we typed backwards into the code. Next, our code was properly doing what it was supposed to. When we typed it in to turn 180 degrees, it would turn around 175 degrees which made the robot completely miss picking up the blocks, placing down the blocks, etc. But overall it was pretty easy, but the code was hard.
