Build Overview:

For this assignment we had to build and program a Clawbot to pick up and stack 3D cubes by itself. The tower of blocks stacked by the robot, must stay standing for 10 seconds after the last block is placed. 
The goal was to make the tallest stack, that stays standing.

Port Assignments:

Code:

Our code is programmed to control what our robot will be doing. The robot is placed in the middle, and is programmed to go forward and pick up the cube with it's claw. Then it has to reverse, and do a 
180 degree turn, then proceed to go forward. It places the cube in it's designated place. And this process repeats over and over again, making the tower in the process.
